# HiResCAM: A High-Resolution Class Activation Mapping Framework for Satellite Change Detection with XAI-Driven Interpretability

Change detection in satellite imagery is critical for monitoring urban dynamics and environmental changes. This work focuses on **mechanistic interpretability** of change detection models by integrating **explainable AI (XAI)** techniques to enhance model transparency and trustworthiness.

We utilize the **LEVIR-CD dataset**, consisting of high-resolution bi-temporal satellite image pairs, and train a **Siamese U-Net neural network** for urban change detection. To interpret the modelâ€™s predictions, we apply the **HiResCAM** method at the feature extraction layers of the network, enabling high-resolution visualization of salient regions that influenced the modelâ€™s decision-making.

## ðŸš€ Quick Start (Kaggle Environment)

### 1. **Setup Kaggle Environment**
- Fork this repository or upload the `HiResCAM full code.ipynb` to a new [Kaggle notebook](https://www.kaggle.com/code).
- Add the **LEVIR-CD dataset** from Kaggle Datasets (`levir-cd` or your custom version).
- Upload the pretrained model downloaded from Google Drive (link above).

### 2. **Run Notebook in Order**

| Step | Section | Purpose |
|------|---------|---------|
| âœ…   | Data Loading & Preprocessing | Load LEVIR-CD images and masks |
| âœ…   | U-Net Siamese Class          | Define the model architecture |
| âœ…   | Load Trained Model           | Load `.pth` weights |
| âœ…   | HiResCAM Class               | Implement interpretability logic |
| âœ…   | Visualize Outputs            | Ground truth, predictions, CAM overlays |

> ðŸ’¡ We recommend using a GPU runtime (e.g., NVIDIA P100) for optimal performance.

## ðŸŽ¯ Output: Interpretable Change Detection

Each test image pair results in:
- Pre-change & Post-change images
- Ground truth change mask
- Predicted change mask
- HiResCAM overlays for both images
- Attention gradient maps indicating key decision areas

The interpretability visualizations reveal that the model predominantly attends to the **post-change image**, raising interesting mechanistic questions for further research.
